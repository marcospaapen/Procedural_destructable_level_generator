# Procedural_destructable_level_generator

A simple complete project that allowes you to create destructable objects by slicing any mesh, 
then use these sliced meshes to create a playable procedural level by adjusting a few parameters
and play that level with a first person controller to test the desctuctable level.

Implemented: 
<br>- Mesh Slicing 
(based on code by Dustin W. found here: http://blinded-am-me.tumblr.com/post/129013886863/simple-mesh-cutting-script-i-made-one-line-call)

TODO: 
<br>- Procedural level generation
<br>- Shooting code (for First Person control I will use the unity standard asset, it works well enough to illustrate functionality)
